<h4>Preening is a natural way chickens clean themselves in addition to a good dust bath. Chickens preen themselves to help release new feathers from their sheaths, remove bugs and pest, and add oil to their feathers to keep them in good condition.
<br>
Dust baths are important to keep parasites at bay and to clean the feathers. The process helps to control parasites and prevents the feathers from becoming too oily. 
<br>
A chicken has the ability to be asleep and awake at the same time. The left eye is connected to the right side of the brain, while the left side of the brain controls the right eye. So the chicken can close one eye and sleep while the other stays open and alert.
<br>
Hens and roosters start crowing or lay eggs at the age of about 5-6 months. This is also the time when they start mating. In order to produce baby chickens, fertile eggs are needed. We get fertile eggs through chicken intercourse where the rooster mounts themselves by grabbing the hen by their neck and claws their feet on their back. A broody hen then sits on these fertile eggs for 3 weeks and you have baby chickens.
