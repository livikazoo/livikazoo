  <h4>Chicken communication is complicated, and is so much more than just vocal communication. A lot of visual and body communication is involved and this is something that has evolved over the years. 
<br>
    Dominance plays a big part in a chicken flock. As flock birds, chickens have a complex social hierarchical system in which there is a ‘pecking order’ for both males and females. Each individual has a specific social status which is recognised by the other members of the flock. This order of social dynamics influences many activities.
 <br>   
    Loud wing flapping with the head held high and the chest puffed out conveys dominance, whilst flapping with a lowered head and running in the opposite direction of the opposing chicken is a way for one chicken to show submission without any physical contact.
   <br> 
    When the alpha hen or rooster position is being threatened, a fight will usually ensue. The fight begins when the birds raise their hackle feathers and point their wings towards the ground, spreading them apart from their body whilst standing as tall as possible and trying to face their opponent down. If neither bird backs down, they will start pecking and jumping at one another, beating each other with their wings. Crouching or running away show submission.
