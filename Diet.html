  <h4> 
    Feeding your chickens is one of, if not the most important, tasks when it comes to raising backyard chickens. Get it right, and you will have a healthy flock who merrily cluck every time you bring them one of their favourite snacks or kitchen scraps! Get it wrong, and it can lead to reduced egg production, deformed eggs, feather picking, and other unwanted behaviour.
<br>
    The basis of any good chicken diet is a high-quality poultry pellet.
  <br>  
    In addition to their core diet of pellets, you can feed them grains such as corn or wheat to give them some variety.
    Chickens love fruit and vegetables, and you can give them this daily. Our girls love vegetable peels, bananas, apple cores, carrots, and broccoli.
    You are safe to feed chickens pretty much any vegetable or fruit except any raw green peels (such as green potato peel) and any citric fruits such as oranges and lemons.
    Chickens are omnivores, so you can also feed them dinner food scraps such as bread, vegetables and protein.
