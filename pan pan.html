        Pan Pan (胖胖)
        How I came up with her name:
        -my family noticed that she was a lot bigger than my other chickens as she was a different breed
        -胖 means big in chinese, so we called her that as a nickname
        Breed: light sussex cross breed
        Born in 2016, bought in 2016
        Personality: curious, nervous, independent
        Why I love Pan Pan:
        Pan Pan is a chicken who is a very curious forager. She went from the bottom of the pecking order with her siblings to the top and I really admire her growth over the years.
